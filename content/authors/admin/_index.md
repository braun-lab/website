Our lab focuses on uniting biophysical interactions with the challenges of managing fisheries in a dynamic ocean. This work necessitates the use of computational, lab and field-based approaches to address the scales of organization in the marine realm (from organism to ocean basin) that drive the pelagic ecosystems we depend on. While our research is rooted in fundamental biological oceanography, we are most interested in questions that connect scientific inquiry to emerging ocean challenges. These questions are typically guided by three major themes of our work: 1) develop knowledge and tools at the interface of fish ecology and oceanography to transform our understanding of the pelagic realm; 2) quantify the mechanistic drivers of physical-biological interactions and their influence on the structure and function of open ocean ecosystems; 3) inform and enable adaptive, ecosystem-based fisheries management in a dynamic ocean.

We aim to make research done in this lab openly available and reproducible, and work to share these approaches with other researchers.
