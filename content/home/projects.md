Current projects in the lab include:

* **Connectivity between surface and deep ocean ecosystems.** Recent work points to the potential significance of mesopelagic biomass for sustaining epipelagic ecosystems. We primarily use tagged animals as “evolutionarily-informed” oceanographers to help us understand the relationship between surface and deep ocean ecosystems and how these relationships may influence ecosystem structure and function.

* **The role of (sub)mesoscale ocean physics as a structural (mechanistic) driver of pelagic ecosystems.** This primarily leverages animal tag data analyzed in the context of remote sensing data and oceanographic model outputs. The feature-centric approaches we employ, combined with high-resolution oceanographic modeling efforts and 3D fish tag data, enable a robust and mechanistic assessment of how and why animals are interacting with specific oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies.

*	**New technologies for studying the pelagic ocean.** Current animal tag technologies are unable to accurately track fish movements and collect climate-quality oceanographic data from highly mobile species and particularly fishes. We’re working to develop new tag technologies that will enable accurate geolocation of animals at depth in the open ocean and that will collect robust oceanographic data from the most biologically-relevant places of the global ocean that may otherwise be difficult to sample and study.

* **Holistic fisheries management in a dynamic ocean.** Our lab’s research at the interface of ocean biology and physics enables us to contribute expertise on causal drivers of distribution and habitat use of pelagic predators. We’re currently expanding this work to a near real time, multi-species modeling effort that will inform the next generation of climate-resilient fisheries management and address challenges specific to managing fisheries in a dynamic and changing ocean.
